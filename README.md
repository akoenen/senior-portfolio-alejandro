# CISC 480 Senior Portfolio – Alejandro Koenen

This portfolio pulls together four projects I completed as a student at the University of St. Thomas. They show different sides of my work: business intelligence, database design, web development, and academic writing.

## 1. Lifestyle & Sleep BI Project (CISC 490)

Repo: https://github.com/akoenen/sleep-lifestyle-bi  

I picked this project because it shows the full BI flow: finding data, cleaning it, modeling it, and then using Power BI to tell a story about how lifestyle and work relate to sleep. It connects well to student wellbeing and the idea of looking at data to understand our habits.

## 2. Vet Clinic Database Project (CISC 450)

Repo: https://github.com/akoenen/db-vet-clinic  

This project shows my work with database design and documentation for a small veterinary clinic. It includes requirements, a schema, and a small Flask app built on top of the database. It’s a good example of how I think about structure and data before and during implementation.

## 3. Dynamic Web Server (CISC 375)

Repo: https://github.com/akoenen/webdev-dynamic  
Live site: https://webdev-dynamic-1.onrender.com/  

Here I moved beyond static pages and built a dynamic server that responds to requests and renders pages from data. It shows my progress in web development and my comfort with Node, routing, and templates.

## 4. MUSC 115 Final Exam Essay – Music & Culture

Repo: https://github.com/akoenen/musc115-final-exam  

This essay is one of my main writing pieces from St. Thomas. It balances out the technical work by showing formal writing and critical thinking about music and culture, which fits the “signature work” and writing-in-the-discipline side of the portfolio.
